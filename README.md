# RedStore E-Commerce Web Application

Welcome to the RedStore e-commerce web application! This project is a static website showcasing an online store with product listings and a shopping cart. It's the first project in my MERN stack course and a step towards mastering web development.

## Project Features

- **Product Pages**: Individual product details with an option to add to the cart.
- **Cart Page**: Displays items added to the cart with the ability to adjust quantities and view the subtotal.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout for a seamless user experience across devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the application, including a custom design with responsive features.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive elements, such as the cart functionality.
